A theorem in mathematics is a statement that describes a pattern or relationship among quantities or structures. A **proof** of a theorem is a justification of the truth of the theorem that follows the principles of logic.

We cannot define all terms or prove all statements from previous ones. We begin with an initial set of statements, called **axioms** (or **postulates**), that are *assumed to be true*. We then derive theorems that are true in any situation where the axioms are true.

# Definitions - Proof & Axioms
- **Proof** of a theorem is a justification of the truth of the theorem that follows the principles of logic.
- **Axioms (postulates)** are an initial set of statements that are assumed to be true.
# Example. Pythagorean Theorem
The Pythagorean' Theorem, for example, is a theorem whose proof is ultimately based on the five axioms of Euclidean geometry. In a situation where the Euclidean axioms are not all true (which can happen), the Pythagorean Theorem may not be true.

There must also be an initial set of **undefined terms**--concepts fundamental to the context of study. In geometry, the concept of a point is an undefined term. In this text the real numbers are not formally defined.

From the axioms and undefined terms, new concepts (new **definitions**) can be introduced. And finally, new theorems can be proved. The structure of a proof for a particular theorem depends greatly on the logical form of the theorem. Proofs may require some ingenuity or insightfulness to put together the right statements to build the justification.

The rules that follow provide guidance about what statements are allowed in a proof, and when. The first four rules enable us to replace a statement with an equivalent or to state something that is always true or is assumed to be true.

# In any proof at any time you may: State An Axium
**State an axiom, an assumption, or a previously proved result.**

# Definition - Lemma
A result that serves as a preliminary step is often called a **lemma**.

# In any proof at any time you may use the *tautology rule*:
**State a sentence whose symbolic translation is a tautology.**

# Example. Proof including tautology
Suppose a proof involves a real number $x$. You may at any time state "Either $x\ge0$ or $x<0$" because this statement is an instance of the tautology $\sim{P\lor P}$.

An important skill for writing proofs is the ability to rewrite a statement in an equivalent form that is more useful or helps clarify its meaning.

# In any proof at any time you amy use the *replacement rule*:
**State a sentence equivalent to any statement earlier in the proof.**

For example, if a proof contains the statement "It is not the case that $x$ is even and prime," we may deduce that "$x$ is not even or $x$ is not prime." this step is said because the first statement has the form $\sim{(P\land Q)}$ and the second has the form $\sim{P}~\lor\sim{Q}$. This is called the ==replacement rule==, using one of DeMorgan's Laws.

An thorough knowledge of the logical equivalences of Theorems [[1.1 Propositions and Connective#Theorem 1.1.1 for propositions P, Q, and R, the following are equivalent|1.1.1]] and [[1.2 Conditionals and Biconditionals#Theorem 1.2.2|1.2.2]] is essential when one uses the replacement rule because these replaces are done routinely, without mentioning the relevant rules of logic.

It is *impossible* to read or write proofs in advanced mathematics without using definitions. Because understanding and using definitions is so crucial, we restate the replacement rule specifically for definitions.
# In any proof at any time you may: Use A Definition
**Use a definition to state an equivalent to a statement earlier in the proof.**

The precise definition of "divides" given in the *Appendix* makes it possible to build proofs involving divisibility properties of $\mathbb{N}$ that are among the first examples of we do. The key idea is that divisibility is defined as it is, so that in a proof we can replace the statmeent "$a$ divides $b$" with the equivalent statement "$b=a*k$ for some integer k." Conversely, if we want to deduce that $a$ divides $b$, the definition tells us that we need a step that says there is an integer $k$ such that $b=a*k$.

The most fundamental rule of reasoning is **modus ponens**, which is based on the tautology $P\land[P\implies Q]\implies Q$. In Section [[1.2 Conditionals and Biconditionals|1.2]] we showed that this tautology means that whenever $P$ and $P\implies Q$ are both true, we may deduce that $Q$ is also true. This rule allows us to make a connection so that we can get from statement $P$ to a *different*  statement $Q$.

# In any proof at any time you may use the *modus ponens* rule:
**After statements $P$ and $P\implies Q$ appear in a proof, state $Q$.

When we use moduse ponens to deduce $Q$ from statements $P$ and $P\implies Q$, the statement $P$ could be an assumption, a compound propositino whose components are hypotheses or previously proved results, or any other statement known to be true at this point. The conditional sentence $P\implies Q$ could also be a previous theorem or tautology or any other statement that appears earlier in the proof.

In this example below notice how the solution (1) states the assumption, (2) replaces the assumption using the definition of differentiability, (3) uses a known result, (4) applies modus ponens to two previous statements, and (5) uses the definition of continuity to deduce the last statement.

# Example. Function Defined On An Interval Containing 2.
Suppose $f$ is a function defined on an interval containing 2, and we know that the derivative of $f$ at 2 exists. Find $\lim_{x\rightarrow0}f(x)=f(2)$. Explain your answer.

We are given that $f'(2)$ exists. Thus $f$ is differentiable at $x=2$. A theorem from calculus says that if $f$ is differentiable at $x$, then $f$ is continuous at $x$. Therefore, $f$ is continuous at $x=2$. We conclude that $lim_{x\rightarrow0}f(x)=f(2)$.

The next example comes from outside mathematics and shows that it may be the *form of* propositions, and not the meaning, that enables us to make a deduction.

# Example. You are at a crime scene and have established the following facts:
1. If the crime did not take place in the billiard room, then Colonel Mustard is guilty.
2. The lead pipe is not the weapon.
3. Either Colonel Mustard is not guilty or the weapon used was a lead pipe.
From these facts and modus ponens, you may construct a proof that shows the crime took place in the billiard room:
## Proof
Statement (1)                                    $\sim{B\implies M}$
Statement (2)                                    $\sim{L}$
Statement (3)                                    $\sim{M}\lor L$
Statements (1) and (2) and (3)         $(\sim{B}\implies M)\land\sim{L}\land(\sim{M}\lor L)$
Statement (1), (2), and (3)                $[(\sim{B}\implies M)\land\sim{L}\land(\sim{M}\lor L)]\implies B$
implies the crime took place in the billiard room.

Therefore, the crime took place in the billiard rom.

The last three statements above are an application of the modus ponens rule: We deduced $Q$ from the statements $P$ and $P\implies Q$, where $Q$ is $B$ and $P$ is $(\sim{B}\implies M)\land\sim{L}\land(\sim{M}\lor L)$.

Because our proofs are always about mathematical phenomena, we also need to understand the subject matter of the proof -- the concepts involved and how they are related. Therefore, when you develop a strategy to construct a proof, keep in mind both the logical form of the theorem's statement and the mathematical concepts involved.

As a general rule, when writing a step in a proof, ask yourself whether deducing that step is valid in the sense that it use one of the five rules above. If the step follows as a result of the use of a tautology, it is not necessary to cite the tautology in your proof. In fact, with practice you should eventually come to write proofs without purposefully thinking about tautologies.

# First Proof Method - Direct Proof
The first-and most important-proof method is the **direct proof** of statement of the form $P\implies Q$, which proceeds in a step-by-step fashion from the antecedent $P$ to the consequent $Q$. Since $P\implies Q$ is false only when $P$ is true and $Q$ is false, it suffices to show that this situation cannot happen. The direct way to proceed is to assume that $P$ is true and show (deduce) that $Q$ is also true. A direct proof of $P\implies Q$ will have the following form:
![[Direct_Proof.png]]
# Example. Prove $x+1$ is even
Let $x$ be an integer. Prove that if $x$ is odd, then $x+1$ is even.
## Proof. $x+1$ is even
Let $x$ be an integer. Suppose $x$ is odd. Then $x=2k+1$ for integer $k$. Then $x+1=(2k+1)+1$. Because $(2k+1)+1=2k+2=2(k+1)$, we see that $x+1$ is the product of 2 and the integer $k+1$. Thus $x+1$ is even. Therefore, if $x$ is an odd integer, then $x+1$ is even.

This form of the proof assumes that the person reading it knows the relevant definitions and the basics of logic. Good proofs include enough detail so that readers with the appropriate background can follow the logical steps and fill in computations as necessary.
