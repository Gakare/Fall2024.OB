A sentence that contains variables an **open sentence** or **predicate** and becomes a proposition only when its variables are assigned to specific values.
	For example, "$x\ge3$" is true when $x$ is given the value 7 and false when $x$ is 2.
- When $P$ is an open sentence with a variable $x$, the sentence is symbolized by $P(x)$.
