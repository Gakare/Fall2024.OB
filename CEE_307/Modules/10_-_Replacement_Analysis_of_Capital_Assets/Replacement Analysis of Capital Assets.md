- Presents procedures for economic analysis of replacement of existing capital asset with a newer ones.
Reasons for replacement of assets:
- Increased operation and maintenance costs for the asset due to aging. The asset becomes less productive as well.
- Asset becoming obsolete: An existing asset may be in excellent working condition, but may have been superseded by newer more efficient technology.
- Changes in product quality requirements: In this case, there may be changes in the demand and/or quality requirements thats the current asset may not be able to meet.

The results of a replacement analysis is normally to recommend one of the following actions:
1. Replace the asset with newer one immediately
2. Keep the existing asset as is
3. Keep the existing asset but perform major overhaul or repairs

Before-tax vs After-tax replacement analysis:
- Replacement analysis may be done based on either
	- before-tax cash flows or
	- after-tax cash flows
- In this class will deal with only replacement analysis based on before-tax cash flows

"Defender" vs "Challenger"
- In replacement analysis,
	- The existing asset that is being considered to be replaced is referred to as the "defender", and
	- The newer asset that is being considered as a replacement to the defender is referred to as the "challenger".
- The challenger is normally the most economical of several newer assets considered, and is often referred to as the "best" challenger.

Some basic considerations
- Sunk costs
- Opportunity cost
# Replacement Analysis: Basic Considerations
Sunk Costs
- These are past expenditures on the asset that cannot be recovered and should therefore not influence current replacement decisions.
- For example, one should not justify keeping an asset simply because it was bought "just recently" and/or for a large sum of money.
- If there is a newer asset that is more economical than the current one, the current asset should be replaced, irrespective of the timing of the past expenditures.
Opportunity Cost
- By definition, this is the potential loss of income for "giving-up" or "not-doing" a given activity.
- In replacement analysis, the opportunity cost of the defender is its market value, in the sense that if the defender is kept (instead of being replaced) there is a potential loss of the revenue that would have been made by selling the asset at its market value.
- Therefore, when doing replacement analysis, the current market value of the defender is considered to be its initial cost.
# Replacement Analysis
Key Parameters
- Marginal Costs
	- It is the cost of owning and operating the asset <u>in one specific year</u>.
	- It is the key parameter calculated of the defender and used in replacement analysis.
- Economic lifetime
	- The "economic lifetime" is the service life of an asset that results in the lowest equivalent uniform annual cost (EUAC) of the asset.
	- The minimum EUAC is the key parameter calculated of the challenger and used in replacement analysis
# Replacement Analysis: Marginal Costs Analysis
- Marginal cost is the cost of owning and operating the asset <u>in one specific year</u>.
- It takes into account
	- the "loss" in the market value of the asset from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, and
	- the corresponding potential loss of interest earnings if the asset had been sold at the beginning of the year and the proceeds invested.
	- the O&M costs for the year.
- This means that the marginal costs will be changing from year to year due to normally the decreasing market values and increasing O&M costs from year to year.

Calculation of Marginal costs
The marginal cost of an asset in any year k, has three components, namely,
1. Loss in the market value of the asset in year k, i.e.,
		Loss in value in year $k = MV_{k-1} - MV_k$
	Where $MV_{k-1}=$ Market value of the asset at the beginning of the year k
		 $MV_k=$ Market value of the asset at the end of the year k
2. Potential loss of interest earnings if the asset had been sold at the beginning of the year for $MV_{k-1}$ and proceeds invested at MARR, i.e.,
		Foregone interest in year $k=(MV_{k-1})(MARR)$
3. The O&M costs for the year k.
# Replacement Analysis: Economic Lifetime
The "<u>economic lifetime</u>" is the service life of an asset that results in the lowest equivalent uniform annual cost (EUAC) of the asset.
- If an asset is replaced frequently (i.e., short service life), the EUAC is dominated by capital costs because of the frequent purchases. However, O&M costs are likely to be low due as the asset is being replaced when still relatively new.
- On the other hand, if an asset is kept for a long service life, capital costs are going to be low, but O&M costs are going to be high as they increase due to aging of the asset.
- Therefore, the "economic" service life is a tradeoff between capital costs and O&M costs.
	- Shorter service lives: higher capital recovery costs; lower annual O&M costs;
	- Longer service lives: lower capital recovery costs; higher annual O&M costs
- Therefore, the economic lifetime is one that minimizes the total annualized costs, as illustrated in the graph below:
![[Economic Lifetime.png]]
Calculation of the EUACs
- Two components of EUAC
	- Capital costs;
	- O&M costs;
Determination of the economic lifetime
- Calculation of the EUACs for different service lives
- Determination of the economic service life
	- Service life with minimum EUAC

Calculation of the EUACs:
- EUAC based on capital costs:
- For an asset with a service life of k years, here is the cash flow diagram:
![[Economic Lifetime CFD.png]]
- EUAC based on O&M costs:
For an asset with a service life of k years:
O&M costs normally vary from year-to-year, therefore calculation of their EUACs require a two step process:
1. First calculate the sum of the PW of the individual year O\&M costs, i.e.,
	PW(O\&M) = sum of the PW of the O&M costs from year 1 to k,
		$=\sum_{j=1}^k O\&M_j(P/F, MARR, j)$
2. Calculate the equivalent annual worth from the PW calculated in step 1, i.e.,
		EUAC = $(PWO\&M)(A/P, MARR,k)$

Significance of the economic lifetime
- In practical terms, the economic lifetimes is the *optimal replacement interval* if one was to replace an asset with an identical asset.
- Consider, for example a rental car company that needs to replace its vehicles frequently, the optimal replacement interval should be equal to the vehicle's economic lifetime. Keeping the vehicles longer or shorter than that would cost the company more in annual ownership costs.
# Replacement Analysis: Relationship between EUAC and Marginal Costs
- Here is further distinction between the marginal cost of an asset for a specific year, from the EUAC of the asset for a specific service life.
- **Marginal cost** is the cost of owning and operating as asset in <u>one specific year k</u>. On the other hand, the **EUAC** is the equivalent average cost for <u>each of the years 1 to k</u> of service life.

- Marginal cost can be used to calculate the EUACs for different service lives.
- The procedure for this is similar to that used int he calculation of the EUACs for O&M costs, which is a two-step process as shown belowe:
	- First calculate the sum of the PW of the individual year marginal costs, i.e.,
		- PWMC = sum of the PW of the marginal costs (MC) from year 1 to k,
			- $=\sum_{j=1}^k MC_j(P/F, MARR, j)$
	- Then calculate the EUAC for the service life of k years from the PW calculated in step 1, i.e.,
		- EUAC = (PWMC)(A/P, MARR, k)
# Part 2
# The Replacement Analysis Procedure
Methodology for replacement analysis
- In general, replacement analysis is performed on assets that are aging and/or nearing the end of their service lives.
- The questions that replacement analysis addresses is whether it is more economical to keep an existing asset (the "defender") for one more year of service or to replace it right away with the best available newer asset (the "challenger").
- This replacement process normally involves calculating the <u>marginal costs</u> of keeping the <u>defender</u> and comparing them with the <u>minimum EUAC</u> of the <u>challenger</u>.

Replacement analysis flowchart:
- The flowchart outlines the steps required when performing replacement analysis between a defender and challenger.
- **Analysis technique 1**: Compare the next-year marginal cost of the defender to the minimum EUAC of the challenger
- **Analysis technique 2**: Compare the minimum EUAC of the defender to the minimum EUAC of the challenger
- **Analysis technique 3**: Compare the EUAC of the defender over its remaining life to the minimum EUAC of the challenger.
![[Flowchart.png]]
## Analysis Technique 1
- Applicable if the marginal costs of the defender are consistently increasing;
- The minimum EUAC of the challenger is compared to the marginal costs of the defender and a decision is made to
	- <u>Replace the defender</u> immediately if the minimum EUAC of the challenger is lower than the first-year marginal cost of the defender (the top figure).
	- <u>Keep the defender</u> if the minimum EUAC of the challenger is higher than the first-year marginal cost of the defender (the bottom figure).
![[graph1.png]]
- If the decision is to <u>keep the defender</u>, an estimate can also be made as to when the defender may be replaced.
- For example, in the figure, the third year marginal cost is the higher than the minimum EUAC of the challenger, meaning that the defender may have to be replaced at end of the second year, assuming that the current estimates for both the defender and the challenger remain the same.
![[graph2.png]]
## Analysis technique 2
- Applicable if the marginal costs of the defender are <u>not</u> consistently increasing, based on the following two conditions;
1. The marginal costs have an initial decreasing trend in and followed by an increasing trend.
2. The minimum EUAC of the challenger must fall in between the two extremes of the marginal costs
- In this case, the procedure is to:
1. Determine the minimum EUAC of the defender.
2. Compare it to the minimum EUAC of the challenger. The decision will be
	- <u>Keep the defender</u> if the minimum of EUAC of the defender is lower than that of the challenger
	- <u>Replace the defender</u> immediately, if the minimum EUAC of the defender is higher than that of the challenger
![[anal graph 2.png]]
- The following two situation require no additional calculations:
1. The minimium EUAC of the challenger is lower than the lowest marginal costs of the defender (top figure):
		In this case, the decision is to <u>replace the defender</u> immediately.
2. The minimum EUAC of the challenger is higher than the marginal cost of the defender (bottom figure):
		In this case the decision is to <u>keep the defender</u> at least one more year.
![[Anal2 graph2.png]]
## Analysis technique 3
- Applicable when there is not enough information about the defender and therefore its marginal costs cannot be calculated. In this case then, using estimates of its current market value, annual O\&M costs and salvage value,
1. Calculate the EUAC of the defender over the entire remaining service life.
2. Compare the EUAC to the minimum EUAC of the challenger. Then the decision will be either:
	- <u>Keep the defender</u> if the EUAC of the defender is lower than the minimum EUAC of the challenger
	- <u>Replace the defender</u> immediatel, if the EUAC of the defender is higher than the minimum EUAC of the challenger.
