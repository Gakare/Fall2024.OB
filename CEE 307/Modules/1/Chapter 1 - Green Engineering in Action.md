The purpose of this book is to develop and illustrate the principles and methodology required to answer the basic economic question of any design: *Do its benefits exceed its costs?*

*Engineering economy* involves the systematic evaluation of the economic merits of proposed solutions to engineering problems. To be economically acceptable (i.e., affordable), *solutions to engineering problems* must demonstrate a positive balance of long-term benefits over long-term costs, and they must also
* promote the well-being and survival of an organization,
* embody creative and innovative technology and ideas,
* permit identification and scrutiny of their estimated outcomes, and
* translate profitability to the "bottom line" through a valid and acceptable measure of merit.

A few more of the myriad situations in which engineering economy plays a crucial role in the analysis of project alternative come to mind:
1. Choosing the best design for a high-efficiency gas furnace
2. Selecting the most suitable robot for a wielding operation on an automotive assembly line
3. Making a recommendation about whether jet airplanes for an overnight delivery service should be purchased or leased
4. Determining the optimal staffing plan for a computer help desk
This shows that engineering economy involves technical analysis, with emphasis on the economic aspects, and has the objective of assisting decisions. 

<font size="5"><b><u>1.2 The Principles of Engineering Economy</b></u></font>
We define the foundation for engineering economy to be a set of <u>principles</u> that provide a comprehensive doctrine for developing the methodology.

<font size="3"><b>Principle 1</b></font>
<font size="4"><u>Develop the Alternatives</u></font>
Carefully define the problem! Then the choice (decision) is among alternatives. The alternatives need to be identified and then defined for subsequent analysis.

A <u>decision situation</u> involves making a choice among two or more alternatives. Developing and defining the alternatives for detailed evaluation is important because of the resulting impact on the quality of the decision.

<font size="3"><b>Principle 2</b></font>
<font size="4"><u>Focus on the Differences</u></font>
Only the differences in expected future outcomes among the alternatives are relevant to their comparison and should be considered in the decision.

Only the differences in the future outcomes of the alternatives are important. Outcomes that are common to all alternatives can be disregarded in the comparison and decision.
The basic purpose of an engineering economic analysis: to recommend a future course of action based on the differences among feasible alternatives.

<font size="3"><b>Principle 3</b></font>
<font size="4"><u>Use a Consistent Viewpoint</u></font>
The prospective outcomes of the alternatives, economic and other, should be consistently developed from a defined viewpoint (perspective).

<font size="3"><b>Principle 4</b></font>
<font size="4"><u>Use a Common Unit of Measure</u></font>
Using a common unit of measurement to enumerate as many of the prospective outcomes as possible will simplify the analysis of the alternative.

It is desirable to make as many prospective outcomes as possible *commensurable* (directly comparable). For economic consequences, a monetary unit such as dollars is the common measure.

<font size="3"><b>Principle 5</b></font>
<font size="4"><u>Consider All Relevant Criteria</u></font>
Selection of a preferred alternative (decision making) requires the use of a criterion (or several criteria). The decision process should consider both the outcomes enumerated in the monetary unit and those expressed in some other unit of measurement or made explicit in a descriptive manner.
