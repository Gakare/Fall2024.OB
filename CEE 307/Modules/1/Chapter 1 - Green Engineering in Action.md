<b><u>1.1 Introduction </b></u>
The purpose of this book is to develop and illustrate the principles and methodology required to answer the basic economic question of any design: *Do its benefits exceed its costs?*

*Engineering economy* involves the systematic evaluation of the economic merits of proposed solutions to engineering problems. To be economically acceptable (i.e., affordable), *solutions to engineering problems* must demonstrate a positive balance of long-term benefits over long-term costs, and they must also
* promote the well-being and survival of an organization,
* embody creative and innovative technology and ideas,
* permit identification and scrutiny of their estimated outcomes, and
* translate profitability to the "bottom line" through a valid and acceptable measure of merit.
