- Gradient cash flows are cash flows that consistently increase or decrease over time.
- Two types of gradient cash flows,
1. <u>Arithmetic gradient</u> cash flows - increase (or decrease) by a **fixed amount** every subsequent period.
2. <u>Geometric gradient</u> cash flows - increase (or decrease) by a **fixed rate** every subsequent period.
# Example. <u>Arithmetic</u> gradient cash flows
"Maintenance cost for a truck are estimated to be \$1,200 in the first year and to increase by \$500 every subsequent year over the five years of its service life. What is the present worth of these maintenance costs at an interest rate of 8%."

# Example. <u>Geometric</u> gradient cash flows
"Ann Doe plans to make 30 regular annual deposits into her retirement account. She will start with a \$1,000 deposit in the first year and increase that by 6% each subsequent year. How much will her retirement account have immediately after making her $30^{th}$ deposit if the account earns 4% per year?"

# Formulae for Arithmetic Gradient Cash Flows
## <u>Finding F in terms of G</u>

- Note that
	- The cash flows increase by a fixed amount G every subsequent period
	- The first G occurs at period 2, not period 1. The reason for this will be apparent later in the examples
	- Therefore, there are $N-1$ periodic cash flows
- The formula for finding F, given G, i and N:
	- $F=G[\frac{(1+i)^N-1}{i^2}-\frac{N}{i}]$
- This means that the factor for converting G into an equivalent F, i.e.,
	- $(F/G,i,N)=[\frac{(1+i)^N-1}{i^2}-\frac{N}{i}]$
- This can also be rewritten as
	- $F=\frac{G}{i}[\frac{(1+i)^N-1}{i}-N]$
- Which is can also be in the form of
	- $F=\frac{G}{i}[(F/A,i,N)-N]$
