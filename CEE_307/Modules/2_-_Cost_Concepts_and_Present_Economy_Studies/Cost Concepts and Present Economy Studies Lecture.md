# 2.1 Introduction
We will start this module by first defining several key types of costs in the production of goods or services. All these costs will be defined from the point of the producer. We will then introduce cost and demand functions and analyses their interaction to determine breakeven and optimal quantities of production, again from the point of view of the producer.

# 2.2 Types Of Costs
## 2.2.1 Fixed and Variable Costs
*Fixed costs* are those costs that do not vary and are not affected by the level of activity or production over the feasible range of operations or capacity.
- For example, if the operations are for factory producing certain widgets, the fixed cost will always be the same, irrespective of how many widgets are produced.
- Examples of fixed costs include the rent or mortgage payment for the factory building, capital costs of the equipment, salaries of management personnel, etc.

*Variable costs* are those costs that vary with the level of activity. They typically increase the level of activity of production is increased. For example, in a production environment, such costs include the raw material costs, direct labor costs, energy and futility costs required in the production.

The total cost is then equal to the sum of the two, i.e, Total cost = fixed costs + variable costs, i.e,
	$TC = C_F + f(D)$
where $C_F=$ fixed costs
	$f(D)=$ the total variable cost as a function of D
	$D=$ the quantity produced
The function $f(D)$ may be linear or non-linear, depending the type of the product or service produced. ==In this  class we will deal only with the linear case==, i.e., $f(D)=C_vD$, where $C_v$, is the variable cost per unit produced.

## Example 1: Fixed and variable costs Linear total cost function
Rebel factory produces a widget that costs $15/unit and $10/unit in labor and material costs, respectively. In addition, administrative, maintenance and capital recovery costs total $7,000 per month. The plant has a production capacity of 1,500 units per month.  
(a) Plot the total cost function from zero units to capacity.  
(b) If the plant is operating at 80% capacity, calculate the total cost of production per month

## 2.2.2 Average and Marginal Costs
*Average cost*: This is the average cost per unit produced or per unit of service provided. Mathematically, it is the total cost divided by thet total number of units produced, i.e,
	$AV=\frac{TC}{D}=\frac{C_f+f(D)}{D}$ 
*Marginal cost*: This is the cost of producing one additional unit. For example, if the total cost of producing D units is $TC_0$ and that of producing $D+1$ units is $TC_1$, then the marginal cost of producing that one additional unit over d is $(TC_1-TC_0)$. Mathematically, this can be written as the derivative of the total cost function with respect to production quantitiy D, i.e,
	$MC=\frac{d}{dD}(C_F+f(D))$
## Example 2: Average and marginal costs - Linear total cost function
Rebel factory produces a widget that costs $15/unit and $10/unit in labor and material costs, respectively. In addition, administrative, maintenance and capital recovery costs total $7,000 per month. The plant has a production capacity of 1,500 units per month. 
(a) Plot the average and marginal costs as functions of the production quantity.  
(b) If the plant is operating at 80% capacity, calculate the total cost of production per month, the average cost per unit and the marginal cost per unit.
## 2.2.3 Sunk and Opportunity Costs
<u>Sunk Cost</u>
A sunk cost is a cost that has been previously incurred and cannot be recovered. It should therefore not be part of any current or future economic analysis. For example, previous costs incurred in purchase of an existing equipment should not influence the decisioun of whether or not replace the equipment now. In other words, you cannot justify keeping an asset based on previous expenditures on the asset. Only current and future cost should matter.

<u>Opportunity Cost</u>
This is a potential revenue, income or benefit that is lost due to not doing a given activity. In other words, this is the potential revneue or benefit of a ''rejected" economic activity.
* Example: if you quit your job to come back to school full time, the income you "lost" by quitting your job is part of your opportunity cost of going to school.
* Example: if you quit your $50,000 per year job and school costs $20,000, your total cost of quitting your job and going to school is $70,000 per year.
# 2.3 Supply Functions
A supply function is ==one that relates the cost of production to the quantity being produced.
* Example of the typical supply functions include the total cost function, the average cost function and the marginal cost function.
Which function to use depends on the analysis being conducted. The functions may be linear or non-linear, depending on type and product or service being provided.

The total cost function in [[Cost Concepts and Present Economy Studies Lecture#Example 1 Fixed and variable costs Linear total cost function|Example 1]] is an example of a supply function, in this case, a linear function, i.e.
	$TC=C_f+C_vD=7,000+25D$

Figure 3 below is a graphical representation of the linear total cost supply function. Note that the y-intercept is equal to the fixed cost, $C_f$, while, for the linear function, the slope of the line is equal to the unit variable, $C_v$.

# 2.4 Demand Functions
A demand function is ==one that relates the revenue generated as a function of the quantity supplied or sold, from the point of view of the supplier.== The price of the product or service is a critical variable in the demand function.
Theoretically, there are normally <u>two alternative price situations</u> that may be faced by a supplier.
1. The first situation is where the price at which the product or service can be sold is fixed, it does not depend on the quantity produced or sold. This is typically the case when a supplier is in a <u>competitive market</u>, that is there are several other producers of the same service or product, and therefore no single producer can influence the market price.
2. The second case, is when the supplier is a <u>monopoly</u> and therefore supplier can set both the quantity produced and price of the product. Normally the price at which the service or product can be sold depends on the quantity supplied. In this case, then, price is a function of quantity supplied.
### 2.4.1 Demand function based on fixed price
If the fixed price is \$P per unit, then the total revenue,
	$TR=P\times D$ 
We will refer to the relationship between total revenue and quantity supplied as "<u>demand function</u>".
For example if, the fixed price is $32 per unit, then
![[TR=32D.png]]
### 2.4.2 Demand function based on price as a function of quantity produced:
In this case, the price per unit varies with a quantity supplied. In general, there is an inverse relationship between supply and price. If a supplier produces a lot of units, the price has to be low in order to sell them all. On the other hand, if only a few units are produced, that price can be higher. The function can be linear or non-linear, depending on the market conditions and/or the type of product or service. In the case of a linear price function, the following is the general functional form:
	Price, $P=a-bD$
	Where **a** and **b** are constants.
Therefore, the total revenue
	$TR=P\times D=aD-bD^2 \rightarrow$ a quadratic function

For example, if a = 89 and b = 0.08, then
	Price, $P=89-0.08D$, and
Total revenue, $TR=89D-0.08D^2$

# 2.5 Interaction of Supply and Demand
For a given production situation, analyzing the interaction between the demand and supply functions helps the producer determine the profite margins that can be achieved for different levels of production. There are normally three main parameters of interest, namely,
1. The breakeven quantity/quantities,
2. The range of profitable production, and
3. The optimal quantity (quantitity that maximizes the total profit).
We are going to look at each of these for the following two cases.
### 2.5.1: Case 1 - Fixed selling price and linear total cost function:
Under this case, given P = unit price per item sold,
	Total revenue, $TR=P\times D\rightarrow$ Demand function
	Total cost, $TC=C_f+C_vD\rightarrow$ Supply function
	Total profit, $TP=TR-TC=P\times D-C_F-C_vD\rightarrow$ Profit function
*Breakeven quantity.* This is the quantity where the total revenue is equal to the total cost (zero profit), i.e,
	$TP=P\times D-C_F-C_VD=0$
	$\rightarrow D_{BE}=\frac{C_F}{P-C_V}$ is the breakeven quantity
*Range of profitable production.* Any quantity of production above $D_{BE}$ results in profit for the producer, and vice versa, i.e.
	If quantity produced, $D>D_{BE}\rightarrow$ profittable production
	If quantity produced, $D<D_{BE}\rightarrow$ deficit production
## Example 3: Demand - Supply interaction for Case 1 demand function
A factory produces widgets that can be sold for $33 each. The fixed and variable costs of production are $4,000 per month and $25 per unit, respectively. The factory has capacity to produce 1,100 units/month.
(a) Plot the supply and demand function on the same graph and, hence, or otherwise, determine
	(i) the minimum number of widgets that should be produced and sold in order for the factory to breakeven
	(ii) the range of profitable production.
(b) How much should the factory should produce to make a 20% profit.
(c) What will be the profit margin if production is at 80% capacity.

### 2.5.2 Case 2: Price as a linear function of demand with a linear total cost function:
In this case, rathe a fixed price per unit, we have a price that is dependend on the level of production. If a lot of units are produced, then a lower price has to be set in order to sell all the units. On the other hand, a lower quantity of production allows for a higher price, thus, we have an inverse price function. In this case, we will assume a linear inverse price function, i.e.
	Price, $P=a-bD$.
Therefore,
	Total revenue, $TR=aD-bD^2\rightarrow$ "Demand function"
Similarly, the total cost is a linear function of the quantity produced, i.e,
	Total cost, $TC=C_F+C_VD\rightarrow$ "Supply function"
Therefore
	Total profit, $TP=TR-TC=aD-bD^2-C_F-C_VD$
	At *breakeven*, $TP=0=aD-bD^2-C_F-C_VD$
		$\rightarrow$ **Solving this quadratic equation** will result in two breakeven quantities $D_1$ and $D_2$ as shown in thex example in Figure 7 below.

Note that, production levels of quantities between the breakeven points are profitable, i.e. $TR>TC$, while quantitites outside of the breakeven points lose money. Hence the range betweend $D_1$ and $D_2$, i.e, $D_1<D<D_2$, is known as the *"range of profitable production"*.

## Optimal production quantity
Looking at Figure 7, at what point between $D_1$ and $D_2$ will be the total profit be a maximum? i.e., what is the production quantity, $D^*$, that will maximize the total profit? This can be determined using calculus methods that are designed to obtain maximum and minimum points of continuous functions. In this case, this will be the point at which the derivative of the total profit function is equal to zero, i.e.,
	Hence $\frac{d}{dD}(TP)=\frac{d}{dD}(aD-bD^2-C_f-C_VD)=a-2bD-C_V=0$
	This gives $D^*=\frac{a-C_V}{2b}$
	This is known as the *optimum production quantity,* $D^*$.
<u>Additional observations</u>
Note that we can re-write the derivative of TP as the difference between the derivatives of TR and TC, i.e.,
	$\frac{d}{dD}(TP)=\frac{d}{dD}(TR)-\frac{d}{dD}(TC)$
at $D^*$, this derivative is equal to zero, i.e. $\frac{d}{dD}(TR)-\frac{d}{dD}(TC)=0$
Which means $\frac{d}{dD}(TR)=\frac{d}{dD}(TC)$
	i.e., at optimal production, the <u>slope of the total revenue curve is equal to the slope of the total cost curve</u>
Note that:
(1) The slope of the total cost function is $\frac{d}{dD}(TC)$ is referred to as the **marginal cost**.
(2) The slope of the total revenue function, $\frac{d}{dD}(TR)$ is referred to as the **marginal revenue**
This means that at *optimal* production, i.e, at the quantity that produces maximum profit
>The marginal cost is **equal** to the marginal revenue.

## Maximum revenue
Another interesting point is the point **at maximum revenue**, which is the peak of the total revenue curve. At the point, the slope of the total revenue curve is zero, i.e.,
	$\frac{d}{dD}(TR)=0$, i.e,
	$\frac{d}{dD}(aD-bD^2)=a-2bD=0\rightarrow D=\frac{a}{2b}\rightarrow$ This is the quantity that maximizes the total revenue.
## Example 4: Demand - Supply interaction for Case 2 demand function
A factory produces widgets at a fixed and variable costs of production are $4,000 per month and $25 per unit, respectively. The price of the widgets is a function of the quantity placed on the market, namely, price per unit $=89-0.08D$, where D is the quantity placed on the market. Determine
(a) The breakeven quantities of production.
(b) The production quantity that maximizes <u>profit</u> and the price and total profit made at that quantity.
(c) The production quantity that maximizes <u>revenue</u> and the price and total profit made at that quantity.

<u>**Discussion questions**</u>
By only interpreting the graphs without doing any calculations, discuss the following questions:
- How will the optimal quantity, $D^*$, the breakeven quantities, $D_1$ and $D_2$ and the maximum revenue quantity, $D_m$ change if the unit variable cost, $C_V$, increases while all the other variables remaining the same? (See [[Cost Concepts and Present Economy Studies Lecture#Figure 8|Figure 8]] - The blue dashed line is the new total cost function). More specifically,
	Will $D^*$ increase, decrease or remain the same?
	Will the range $D_1$ ~$D_2$ become wider, narrower or remain the same?
	Will $D_m$ increase, decrease or remain the same?
* Similarly, how will the quantities, $D^*$, $D_1$, $D_2$, and $D_m$ change if the fixed cost, $C_F$, increases while all the other variables remaining the same? (See Figure 9 - The blue dashed line is the new total cost function)
- Finally, how will the quantities change if the fixed cost increased so much that the total cost curve is always above the totola revenue curve? (Figure 10)
