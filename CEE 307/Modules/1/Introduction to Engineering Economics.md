# <b><u>What is Engineering Economics?</u></b>
* Engineering economics is the study of the concepts and procedures for economic analysis and evaluation of engineering projects
* Key concept: Analysis of time value of money and its effects on
	* alternative project designs, implementation and/or operational strategies
	* alternative engineering investments
* Objective: To provide concepts and procedures for systematic economic evaluation of life-cycle costs and benefits of engineering projects/investments in order to:
	* Decide whether or not to carry out a project
	* Choose between mutually exclusive projects
	* Choose among independent projects, i.e., capital budgeting
# <b><u>Procedures in Engineering Economics?</u></b>
Some Basic issues:
* Identification and quantification of life-cycle benefits and costs project or project alternatives
* Comparative analysis of the benefits and costs while taking into account
	* the of time value of money
	* the effects of depreciation, taxes, inflation and uncertainty

<b><u>Applications of Engineering Economics</u></b>
In Engineering Design: Choice between different
* Materials used in production
* Product designs
* Production equipment and processes
Examples of applications outside of engineering, i.e., in "daily life"
* Purchasing/leasing of automobiles
* Home mortgage financing
* Personal investments
* Economics of home improvements

<u>The Decision-Making Procedure</u> (Section 1.3 Textbook [[Chapter 1 - Green Engineering in Action#1.3 Engineering Economy and the Design Process|Engineering Economy and the Design Process]])
1. Problem recognition
2. Development of feasible alternatives
3. Development of cash flows and outcomes
4. Selection of evaluation criteria
5. Analysis and comparison of alternatives
6. Selection of preferred alternative
7. Performance Monitoring and Post-evaluation

<u>Applications  of Engineering Economics</u>
Principles Governing the Engineering Economics Procedure (Section 1.3 Textbook)
1. Develop the alternatives
2. Focus on the differences
3. Use a consistent viewpoint
4. Use a common unit of measure
5. Consider all relevant criteria
6. Make risk and uncertainty explicit
7. Revisit your decisions
