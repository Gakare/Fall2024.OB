After completing this module, you will be expected to have learned:
1. Define "engineering economics" 
a.  [[Chapter 1 - Green Engineering in Action#1.1 Introduction|Engineering economics]] is the study of the concepts and procedures for economic analysis and evaluation of engineering concepts.
Deep Diving into engineering economy, it involves the systematic evaluation of the economic merits of proposed solutions to engineering problems.

2. Describe the need for engineering economics
a.  The need for engineering economics is to create an economically acceptable (i.e., affordable), solutions to engineering problems that must demontsrate a positive balance of long-term benefits over long-term costs.

3. Describe the application of engineering economics to engineering design
a. Look at [[Introduction to Engineering Economics#<b><u>Applications of Engineering Economics</u></b>|Intro to Engineering Economics]].

4. Describe the decision-making procedure to economic analysis of projects
a. Look at [[Chapter 1 - Green Engineering in Action#1.3 Engineering Economy and the Design Process#<font size="4">Table 1-1</font> <font size="3"><b>The general relationship between the Engineering Economic Analysis Procedure and the Engineering Design Process</b></font>|Table 1-1]].

5. Describe the principles that govern engineering economics analysis
a. Look at [[Chapter 1 - Green Engineering in Action#1.2 The Principles of Engineering Economy|Principles]].
