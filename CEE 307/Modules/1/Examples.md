# Example 1-1 Defining the Problem and Developing Alternatives
The management team of a small furniture-manufacturing company is under pressure to increase profitability to get a much-needed loan from the bank to purchase a more wooden pattern-cutting machine. One proposed solution is to sell waste wood chips and shavings to a local charcoal manufacturer instead of using them to fuel space heaters for the company's office and factory areas.
	<b>a.</b> Define the company's problem. Next, reformulate the problem in a variety of creative ways.
	<b>b.</b> Develop at least one potential alternative of your reformulated problems in Part (a). (Don't concern yourself with feasibility at this point.)
## Solution
a. The company's problem appears to be that revenues are not sufficiently covering costs. Other ways to reformulate the problem are:
1. The problem is to increase revenues while reducing costs.
2. The problem is to maintain revenues while reducing costs.
3. The problem is an accounting system that provides distorted cost information.
4. The problem is that the new machine is really not needed (and hence there is no need for a bank loan).
b. Based only on reformulation 1, an alternative is to sell wood chips and shavings as long as increased revenue exceeds extra expenses that may be required to heat the buildings. Another alternative is to discontinue the manufacture of specialty items and concentrate on standardized, high-volume products. Yet another alternative is to pool purchasing, accounting, engineering, and other white-collar support services with other small firms in the area by contracting with a local company involved in providing these services.
