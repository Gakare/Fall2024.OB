# Example 1-1 Defining the Problem and Developing Alternatives
The management team of a small furniture-manufacturing company is under pressure to increase profitability to get a much-needed loan from the bank to purchase a more wooden pattern-cutting machine. One proposed solution is to sell waste wood chips and shavings to a local charcoal manufacturer instead of using them to fuel space heaters for the company's office and factory areas.
	<b>a.</b> Define the company's problem. Next, reformulate the problem in a variety of creative ways.
	<b>b.</b> Develop at least one potential alternative of your reformulated problems in Part (a). (Don't concern yourself with feasibility at this point.)
## Solution
a. The company's problem appears to be that revenues are not sufficiently covering costs. Other ways to reformulate the problem are:
1. The problem is to increase revenues while reducing costs.
2. The problem is to maintain revenues while reducing costs.
3. The problem is an accounting system that provides distorted cost information.
4. The problem is that the new machine is really not needed (and hence there is no need for a bank loan).
b. Based only on reformulation 1, an alternative is to sell wood chips and shavings as long as increased revenue exceeds extra expenses that may be required to heat the buildings. Another alternative is to discontinue the manufacture of specialty items and concentrate on standardized, high-volume products. Yet another alternative is to pool purchasing, accounting, engineering, and other white-collar support services with other small firms in the area by contracting with a local company involved in providing these services.

# Example 1-2 Application of the Engineering Economic Analysis Procedure
A friend of yours brought a small apartment building for $100,000 in a college town. She spent $10,000 of her own money for the building and obtained a mortgage from a local bank for the remaining $90,000. The *annual* mortgage payment to the bank is $10,500. Your friend also expects that annual maintenance on the building and grounds will be $15,000. There are four apartments (two bedrooms each) in the building that can each be rented for $360 per month.
Refer to seven-step procedure in [[Chapter 1 - Green Engineering in Action#<font size="4">Table 1-1</font> <font size="3"><b>The general relationship between the Engineering Economic Analysis Procedure and the Engineering Design Process</b></font>|Table 1-1]] (left-hand side) to answer these questions:
	a. Does your friend have a problem? If so, what is it?
	b. What are her alternatives? (Identify at least three)
	c. Estimate the economic consequences and other required data for the alternatives in Part (b).
	d. Select a criterion for discriminating among alternatives, and use it to advise your friend on which course of action to pursue.
	e. Attempt to analyze and compare the alternatives in view of at least one criterion in addition to cost.
	f. What should your friend do based on the information you and she have generated?
## Solution
a. Doing some calculations in order to see her losses and gains in a year we can see that her losses generate to $\$10,500+\$15,000=\$25,500$. While her gains when calculated annually per apartment are $\$360\ *$ 12 months = $\$4,320$ and she has 4 apartments therefore her total gains annually would be $\$4,320 * 4 = \$17,280$. As we can see there is problem in that her losses are greater than her gains therefore she would be losing $\$25,500 - \$17,280 = \$8,220$ every year.
