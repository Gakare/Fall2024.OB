# 1.1 Introduction
The purpose of this book is to develop and illustrate the principles and methodology required to answer the basic economic question of any design: *Do its benefits exceed its costs?*

*Engineering economy* involves the systematic evaluation of the economic merits of proposed solutions to engineering problems. To be economically acceptable (i.e., affordable), *solutions to engineering problems* must demonstrate a positive balance of long-term benefits over long-term costs, and they must also
* promote the well-being and survival of an organization,
* embody creative and innovative technology and ideas,
* permit identification and scrutiny of their estimated outcomes, and
* translate profitability to the "bottom line" through a valid and acceptable measure of merit.

A few more of the myriad situations in which engineering economy plays a crucial role in the analysis of project alternative come to mind:
1. Choosing the best design for a high-efficiency gas furnace
2. Selecting the most suitable robot for a wielding operation on an automotive assembly line
3. Making a recommendation about whether jet airplanes for an overnight delivery service should be purchased or leased
4. Determining the optimal staffing plan for a computer help desk
This shows that engineering economy involves technical analysis, with emphasis on the economic aspects, and has the objective of assisting decisions. 

## 1.2 The Principles of Engineering Economy
We define the foundation for engineering economy to be a set of <u>principles</u> that provide a comprehensive doctrine for developing the methodology.

<font size="3"><b>Principle 1</b></font>
<font size="4"><u>Develop the Alternatives</u></font>

	Carefully define the problem! Then the choice (decision) is among alternatives. The alternatives need to be identified and then defined for subsequent analysis.

A <u>decision situation</u> involves making a choice among two or more alternatives. Developing and defining the alternatives for detailed evaluation is important because of the resulting impact on the quality of the decision.

<font size="3"><b>Principle 2</b></font>
<font size="4"><u>Focus on the Differences</u></font>

	Only the differences in expected future outcomes among the alternatives are relevant to their comparison and should be considered in the decision.

Only the differences in the future outcomes of the alternatives are important. Outcomes that are common to all alternatives can be disregarded in the comparison and decision.
The basic purpose of an engineering economic analysis: to recommend a future course of action based on the differences among feasible alternatives.

<font size="3"><b>Principle 3</b></font>
<font size="4"><u>Use a Consistent Viewpoint</u></font>

	The prospective outcomes of the alternatives, economic and other, should be consistently developed from a defined viewpoint (perspective).

<font size="3"><b>Principle 4</b></font>
<font size="4"><u>Use a Common Unit of Measure</u></font>

	Using a common unit of measurement to enumerate as many of the prospective outcomes as possible will simplify the analysis of the alternative.

It is desirable to make as many prospective outcomes as possible *commensurable* (directly comparable). For economic consequences, a monetary unit such as dollars is the common measure.

What should you do with the outcomes that are not economic (i.e., the expected consequences that cannot be translated (and estimated) using the monetary)? First, if possible, quantify the expected future results using an appropriate unit of measurements for each outcome. If this is not feasible for one or more outcomes, describe these consequences explicitly so that the information is useful to the decision maker in the comparison of the alternatives.

<font size="3"><b>Principle 5</b></font>
<font size="4"><u>Consider All Relevant Criteria</u></font>

	Selection of a preferred alternative (decision making) requires the use of a criterion (or several criteria). The decision process should consider both the outcomes enumerated in the monetary unit and those expressed in some other unit of measurement or made explicit in a descriptive manner.

In engineering economic analysis, the primary criterion relates to the long-term financial interests of the owners. This is based on the assumption that available capital will be allocated to provide maximum monetary return to the owners. Often, though, there are other organizational objectives you would like to achieve with your decision, and these should be considered and given weight in the selection of an alternative.

<font size="3"><b>Principle 6</b></font>
<font size="4"><u>Make Risk and Uncertainty Explicit</u></font>

	Risk and uncertainty are inherent in estimating the future outcomes of the alternatives and should be recognized in their analysis and comparison.

The analysis of the alternatives involves projecting or estimating the future consequences associated with each of them.

<font size="3"><b>Principle 7</b></font>
<font size="4"><u>Revisit Your Decisions</u></font>

	Improved decision making results from an adaptive process; to the extent practical, the initial projected outcomes of the selected alternative should be subsequently compared with actual results achieved.

The evaluation of results versus the initial estimate of outcomes for the selected alternative is often considered impracticable or not worth the effort. Too often, no feedback to the decision-making process occurs. Organizational discipline is needed to ensure that implemented decisions are routinely post-evaluated and that the results are used to improve future analyses and the quality of decision making. 

## 1.3 Engineering Economy and the Design Process

	An engineering economy study is accomplished using a structured procedure and mathematical modeling techniques. The economic results are then used in a decision situation that normally includes other engineering knowledge and input.

## 1.3.1 Problem Definition
A problem must be well understood and stated in an explicit form before the project team proceeds with the rest of the analysis

The term *problem* is used here generically. Recognition of the problem is normally stimulated by internal or external organizational needs or requirements.

Once the problem is recognized, its formulation should be viewed from a *systems perspective*. That is, the boundary or extent of the situation needs to be carefully defined, thus establishing the elements of the problem and what constitutes its environment. 

Evaluation of the problem includes refinement of needs and requirements, and information from the evaluation phase may change the original formulation of the problem.

## 1.3.2 Development of Alternatives
The two primary actions of step 2 are (1) searching for potential alternatives and (2) screening them to select a smaller group of feasible alternatives for detailed analysis. the term *feasible* here means that each alternative selected for further analysis is judged, based on preliminary evaluation, to meet or exceed the requirements established for the situation.

### 1.3.2.1 Searching for 
In the discussion of Principle 1 [[#1.2 The Principles of Engineering Economy]], creativity and resourcefulness were emphasized as being absolutely essential to the development of potential alternatives. The difference between good alternatives and great alternatives depends largely on an individual's or group's *problem-solving efficiency*. Ways to increase efficiency:
1. Concentrate on redefining one problem at a time in Step 1.
2. Develop many redefinitions for the problem.
3. Avoid making judgments as new problem definitions are created.
4. Attempt to redefine a problem in terms that are dramatically different from the original Step 1 problem definition.
5. Make sure that the *true problem* is well researched and understood.

### 1.3.2.2 Developing Investment Alternatives
Engineers are at the very heart of creating value for a firm by turning innovative and creative ideas into new or reengineered commercial products and services. Most of these ideas require investment of money, and only a few of all feasible ideas can be developed, due to lack of time, knowledge, or resources.

Consequently, most investment alternatives created by good engineering ideas are drawn from a larger population of equally good problem solutions. Studies have concluded that designers and problem solvers tend to pursue a few ideas that involve "patching and repairing" an old idea. This section outlines two approaches that have found wide acceptance in the industry for developing sound investment alternatives by removing some of the barriers to creative thinking: (1) classical brainstorming and (2) the Nominal Group Technique (NGT).
