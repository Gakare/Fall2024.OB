- This modules presents techniques of economic evaluation of mutually exclusive alternatives using the PW, FW, or AW methods.
- The methods are presented in this video in that order.
# Economic Comparisons Using the PW Method
- Alternatives are compared based on the equivalent net present worth (PW) of the lifecycle cash flows at a given ==minimum attractive rate of return (MARR)==, i.e.,
	- Net PW = PW(revenues) - PW(Costs)
- For a typical alternative (see accompanying cash flow diagram) with an initial investment P, service life N, salvage value S and uniform periodic revenues and costs $A_R$ and $A_C$, respectively, the net present worth is calculated as follows:
	- Net $PW=A_R(P/A,i,N)+S(P/F,i,N)-A_C(P/A,i,N)-P$
Where $i$ is the MARR per period.

- In general, for each investment alternative,
	- A ==positive or zero net PW== means that the investment has a ==rate of return at least equal to the MARR==, and therefore it is an ==economical investment== and ==should be recommended for implementation==.
	- On the other hand, a ==negative net PW== means that the investment has a ==rate of return lower than MARR==, and the investmenent is not economical and ==should normally be rejected==.
- When comparing ==investment alternatives==, the alternative with the ==highest net PW== should be preferred.
- When comparing ==cost-only alternatives==, the one with the ==lowest PW of costs== should be preferred.
- Note that the comparisons should only be made based on the <u>same study period</u>, i.e., the PWs have to be calculated based on the same study period for all alternatives being compared.
