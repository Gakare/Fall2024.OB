<u>Presents</u>
- Methods of handling uncertainty in the estimated values of input parameters of alternatives when performing economic analysis.
#  Sources of uncertainty in the input data
- Most of the uncertainty is due to the difficulties in obtaining accurate estimates of <u>future cash flows</u> and/or <u>occurrence of events</u>. This is particularly true for
	- Analysis involving <u>long study periods</u>
	- Analysis involving <u>new activities</u>, <u>products</u> or <u>services</u>
	- Analysis of <u>big projects</u> involving several interacting activities and project objectives
	- Analysis of <u>projects involving occurrence</u> of natural events, such as earthquakes, rainstorms, etc.
Uncertainty in the input data may be in the form of
- <u>Probability, or probability distributions</u>, of
	- occurrence of events
	- estimated values of inputs paramaters
- Range of estimates, i.e.,
	- most likely values
	- optimistic values (i.e., under best case scenarios)
	- pessimistic values (i.e., under worst case scenarios)
These range of estimates may or may not have associated probabilities of occurrence
# Examples of statements that describe uncertainty in input data
- Probability distribution:
	- The annual revenue for an investment is expected to be <u>normally distributed</u> with a mean of <u>\$450,000</u> and a standard deviation of <u>\$60,000</u>.
- Probability of occurrence:
	- Possible market values of an asset at the end of its service life are as follows: \$50,000 at a <u>probability</u> of 50%; \$60,000 at 30% <u>probability</u> and \$70,000 at 20% <u>probability</u>.
	- Note that since these are mutually exclusive outcomes, the sum of the probabilities is equal to 1.
- Range of estimates
	- The service life of a new equipment is uncertain. It is most likely going be 6 years, although it could be as long as 10 years or as short as 4 years.
	- Note that the lowest estimate, i.e., the 4 years is referred to as the "pessimistic" estimate, while the highest estimate (the 10 years) is the "optimistic" estimate.
# Methods of Analysis
- Designed to enable incorporating the uncertainty in input data when performing economic analysis of investments and/or projects.
- Methods presented
	1. Expected values method
		- Includes a brief discussion of "decision trees"
	2. Range of estimates method
	3. Breakeven analysis
	4. Sensitivity analysis
# Method of Expected Values
- In this case, <u>each input variable that is subject</u> to uncertainty will have several possible values or outcomes each assigned with a <u>probability of occurrence</u>.
- Analysis is then based on the "expected" values of such variables based on the laws of probability, i.e., the "expected" value of a variable that is subject to several possible outcomes,
	- $=\sum_{j=1}^{N}\{\text{prob}(\text{outcome}_j)\times\text{value}(\text{outcome}_j)\}$
	Where N is the total number of possible outcomes, and
	- $\sum_{j=1}^{N}\{\text{prob}(\text{outcome}_j)\}=1$
# Example:
- Possible market values of an asset at the end of its service life are as follows: \$50,000 at a probabiltity of 50%; \$60,000 at 30% probability and \$70,000 at 20% probability.
- Calculate the "expected" market value of the asset.

# Example 3a (09:46)
- A homeowner is planning to buy fire insurance for her new \$200,000 home. After much research, the lowest insurance premium she found was for \$580 per year. To check whether the premium is reasonable or not, the homeowner decided to get more information on the risk of fire damage for the home. The local fire department provided her with the following annual probabilities for fire loss in any year
**Solution (12:50)**
- To evaluate whether the quoted premium is reasonable or not, we calculate the "expected" annual cost of fire damage based on probabilistic data given, and compare it to the premium.
- Note that here we have four possible "outcomes", i.e., levels of fire damage in any given year, and their associated probabilities of occurrence.
- Hence, expected annual cost of fire damage
Note that the solution shows that
- The annual insurance premium (\$580) is higher than the expected annual cost of fire damage (\$420).
- From the <u>insurance company's point of view</u>, the company will spend an average of \$420 per year per home, and that differenc between the premium and expected fire loss is the revenue necessary for the company to cover <u>administrative and operating costs</u> as well as make a <u>profit</u>.
- From the <u>point of view of the homeowner</u>, the choice is between
1) <u>Not buying insurance</u> and <u>risking having to spend huge sums of money</u>, that the homeowner may not afford, when a fire occurs, or
2) <u>buy insurance</u> and be willing to <u>pay premium</u> that is higher than the expected annual fire damage in order to <u>transfer the risk of potential future higher costs</u> of fire damage to the insurance company.
